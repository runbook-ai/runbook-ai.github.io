## **Runbook AI Privacy Policy**

This policy details how the Runbook AI browser extension, an AI web automation tool for Chrome, and also its companion website ([https://runbook-ai.github.io](https://runbook-ai.github.io)), handle your data and ensures your privacy.

### **Your Data Stays Local**

Runbook AI is designed for privacy. Here's how:

* **Entirely In-Browser:** The extension operates solely within your browser. It doesn't use external servers to process your data. The website acts as a gateway to fetch Gmail via Google OAuth integration and trigger the browser automation tasks in the extension via Chrome external messaging. It does not use any other external servers to process your data.  
* **No Data Collection by Developers:** We, the developers of Runbook AI, **do not** collect, store, or process any user data. Your information never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.  
* **Credentials and Cookies Stay Put:** Your login credentials and browser cookies are never extracted from your browser or sent anywhere else. They remain secure on your local machine.

### **How We Interact with LLM Providers**

For Runbook AI's AI features to function, some data needs to be shared, but only with your chosen Large Language Model (LLM) provider:

* **Direct Transmission:** Web page data, including screenshots and HTML content, is sent directly from your browser to the LLM provider you select.  
* **Essential for AI:** This data transfer is necessary for the AI functionality of the extension to work correctly.  
* **No Other Third Parties:** No platforms other than your chosen LLM provider will have access to this data.  
* **LLM Provider's Privacy Policy Applies:** Your data privacy during these interactions is subject to the privacy policies of the specific LLM provider you are using.

### **Managing Your API Keys**

Runbook AI requires you to provide your own API keys for LLM providers. Here's what that means for your privacy:

* **Local Storage Only:** Your API keys are stored locally within your browser and are never transmitted to Runbook AI servers.  
* **Your Responsibility:** You are responsible for managing and securing your API keys in accordance with your LLM provider's terms of service.

### **Your Control Over Your Data**

You have complete control over your data within the Runbook AI extension:

* **Clear Settings:** You can clear your settings at any time directly through the extension's interface.  
* **Uninstall to Remove All Data:** Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data associated with Runbook AI from your browser.

### **Updates to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy from time to time.
